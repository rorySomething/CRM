Re-inventing a mildly complicated wheel!

The slow birth of yet another Collision-Radiative Modeling program.
Mostly an excuse to practice coding and some mathematics and learn some physics.

This is for plasma physics,
so don't waste your time reading any more if that's not your thing.

Ideally this will eventually include "accurate" data for many atomic species.
Initially targeting ~atmospheric/low pressure plasmas
He, N, C, O
Still uncertain of how to acquire all relevant data for
diatomics and molecular fragments...

Most of the data can probably be acquired from http://open.adas.ac.uk/
but we need consent to distribute their data with the software.
Otherwise, generate data using AUTOSTRUCTURE code from http://amdpp.phys.strath.ac.uk/autos/
OPEN-ADAS I believe already has software to carry out what is intended here hence the re-inventing.
